## Endless Running Math - Unity 2019.3.13f1


Endless running math is a personal project created in Unity3D.Â 

It is the combination of my first ever game (endless runner) and a math game (another personal project)

Gameplay:

* A, S, D (or J, K, L) (or on-screen Buttons) to choose the correct answer and Jump.

* Jump on time to avoid the obstacle.

* 1, 2, 3, 4 to toggle an operation.
